"""Regenerate sbom/tools.cdx.json from tools/tools.yaml.

Downloads every declared artifact, for every declared architecture, and
records its sha256. Emits a CycloneDX 1.6 SBOM (ECMA-424) -- the format
Trivy, Grype, osv-scanner and Dependency-Track all consume natively.

Run this whenever tools/tools.yaml changes:

    python3 scripts/gen_tool_sbom.py

Why a real SBOM instead of a bespoke lock file: a statically linked binary
installed into /usr/local/bin is invisible to any scanner that works off a
package database, because there is no dpkg or pip record of it. A scan of
this image would report clean while kubectl and yq sit in it unmanaged. A
CycloneDX component with a PURL is what lets CVE matching see them.

The sha256 recorded here is ALSO the build-time integrity check:
scripts/install_tools.sh installs from this file, verifying each download
against the hash below. tools.yaml is never read at image build time, so a
version bumped there but not re-hashed here cannot reach an image.
